## CppChallenges
A collection of snippets that I didn't want to make a full repo for, but want to keep.

### Challenges
* [Base62](base62.cpp) - Converting numbers to and from base62 (a-z A-Z 0-9) using the ASCII table. Originally made to make MySQL `AUTO INCREMENT` ID's look nicer
* [Kahoot websocket token](kahoot.cpp) - Gets and decodes the token needed to join a live Kahoot game. Includes an eval system that implements BMDAS
* [Magnet Details](magnetdetails.cpp) - Parses info hash, name, and trackers from a `magnet:` URI, and resolves tracker hostnames.
